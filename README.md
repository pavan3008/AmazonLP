## 0. **AI Response Failure Due to Query Reformulation and Conversation ID Issue**

- **Situation**: Stakeholders noticed that the AI responses were not being generated correctly during conversations.

- **Task**: My task was to find out why the AI responses were failing and resolve the issue promptly to prevent further disruptions. I had to dig deep into both the backend and the conversation history mechanism to find the root cause, all while ensuring minimal disruption to the live environment.

- **Action**: I began by running multiple tests to replicate the issue. Upon reviewing the logs, I found that the problem originated from query reformulation, which I used before sending the request to the RAG model. The query reformulation was entirely based on conversation history using the conversation ID. However, the logs revealed that the conversation ID was not being updated when users started a new chat, causing older messages to be included in the query reformulation, which then led to incorrect AI responses. After identifying the issue, I realized the problem was on the frontend side—the frontend team had not updated the conversation ID when starting a new chat.

  When I brought this up in a working session, the frontend team raised their hands, explaining that they were in a code freeze, and any changes could impact the flow. Additionally, they needed approval for any hotfixes. With time ticking and a solution needed urgently, I decided to think outside the box.

  I quickly devised a new approach, introducing a **vagueness check service** that would run in parallel to the query reformulation. This service would check if the incoming user query was vague or needed more information. If the query was identified as vague, it would proceed with the query reformulation as originally intended. However, if the query was clear, it would treat it as a new conversation, bypassing the older message history. This approach effectively worked around the frontend limitation while ensuring that AI responses were generated correctly.

- **Result**: The vagueness check service proved to be an innovative solution. It allowed us to continue with accurate AI responses without relying on a frontend hotfix, which would have delayed the project. The final solution was delivered on time, and the stakeholders were satisfied with the improved accuracy of the responses. This approach also became a permanent part of our AI query processing pipeline, preventing similar issues from occurring in the future.

- **What I Gained**: This experience enhanced my ability to troubleshoot complex systems and come up with quick, creative solutions when faced with limitations. I also deepened my understanding of how backend systems interact with frontend applications and learned to handle inter-team dependencies during critical moments. Moreover, I developed a new appreciation for working around technical constraints while ensuring the solution delivered was efficient and impactful.

## 1. **Production Issues and LLM Vagueness Check**

- **Situation**: I was working on a critical event where our production system was generating recommendations using an LLM (Large Language Model). As the event drew near, we realized that the recommendations being produced were incorrect and vague, which could severely impact the success of the event. The issue surfaced last-minute, and fixing it without downtime in production was crucial to avoid disappointing both our users and stakeholders.
  
- **Task**: My primary task was to analyze the root cause of the problem, identify a solution, and implement it quickly to ensure the system would deliver accurate recommendations before the event started. I also needed to ensure that this issue wouldn’t occur again in future production environments.

- **Action**: I immediately began by diving into the system logs and analyzing the LLM’s responses. I quickly identified that the issue stemmed from vague outputs from the model, which led to incorrect recommendations being surfaced to the user. With little time to spare, I devised a solution: a Vagueness Check service. This service validated the clarity of LLM responses, flagging ambiguous ones and routing them for further refinement before presenting them to users. To ensure there was no downtime, I worked closely with the DevOps team to deploy this service without disrupting production. Throughout the process, I communicated updates to stakeholders, assuring them that the issue was being actively resolved.

- **Result**: The Vagueness Check service was deployed just in time for the event, significantly improving the quality of the recommendations by filtering out unclear outputs. As a result, the event proceeded smoothly, with no further issues reported. The service improved the accuracy of the LLM's recommendations by 30%, and it became a permanent part of our production pipeline. Stakeholders praised the quick turnaround, and the event was deemed a success. This solution also set a precedent for how we handle similar issues in the future.

- **What I Gained**: This experience strengthened my ability to analyze production issues under pressure and devise quick, effective solutions.

## 2. **Admin Dashboard and Automating Feedback**

- **Situation**: I was tasked with delivering an admin dashboard for a client in just one week. The dashboard needed to automate feedback summaries and generate Quarterly Business Review (QBR) reports, a process that was previously done manually. The manual process was slow, error-prone, and time-consuming. The client’s expectation was high, and the tight timeline created significant pressure to deliver a high-quality solution quickly.

- **Task**: My main responsibility was to design and implement a dashboard that not only met the client’s needs but also automated the feedback and reporting processes. I needed to ensure the solution was robust, delivered on time, and eliminated the inefficiencies of the previous manual system.

- **Action**: Given the short timeline, I knew I had to take immediate action. I began by analyzing the client's requirements in detail and decided to leverage LangChain, a powerful language model-based tool, to automate the feedback summarization and QBR report generation. I built an integration where the LLM could process customer feedback, summarize it, and auto-generate the necessary reports. This eliminated the need for manual effort. I also designed a backend system that fed this data into the admin dashboard in real time, allowing the client to generate reports with just a few clicks. Simultaneously, I worked closely with the frontend team to ensure that the user interface was intuitive and easy to navigate. Despite the tight deadline, I communicated regularly with the client to gather feedback and adjusted the solution based on their evolving needs.

- **Result**: The dashboard was delivered on time, fully automated, and met all of the client’s requirements. The automation reduced the time required to generate reports by 80%, allowing the client to create accurate and timely reports in minutes rather than days. The client was extremely satisfied with the solution, as it greatly improved their operational efficiency and reduced manual errors.

## 3. **Fructose Library Integration**

- **Situation**: I was tasked with integrating a new library called Fructose into our GenAI solution. Initially, this seemed straightforward, but as I dove deeper into the integration process, I discovered that several critical features, such as AzureChatOpenAI, were missing. Additionally, some of the features that were available in Fructose were incompatible with our company’s architecture. The team was inclined to abandon the library due to these limitations, as it wasn’t fully supported for our needs. However, I saw potential in leveraging this library and felt that with some customization, we could make it work.

- **Task**: My responsibility was to find a way to successfully integrate Fructose into our system, even though the library lacked key features and support for our architecture. I needed to come up with a custom solution that wouldn’t disrupt our existing systems, while also ensuring that the integration would be scalable and maintainable in the long run.

- **Action**: I began by thoroughly researching Fructose’s internal workings to understand its architecture. I quickly identified the gaps and limitations and realized that a standard integration wouldn’t work. Instead of abandoning the library, I proposed building a custom flow that would extend Fructose’s functionality to meet our needs. I created additional code that adapted our existing architecture to work with Fructose, allowing us to bypass the missing features. I also made sure that this custom flow was modular and scalable so it could evolve alongside the library. Throughout this process, I worked closely with the DevOps and backend teams to ensure the custom solution was compatible with our infrastructure and could be maintained easily. I also documented my work to make the solution accessible for future developers and possible system upgrades.

- **Result**: The custom integration was successfully implemented, allowing us to use Fructose despite its limitations. This not only enabled us to complete the project but also ensured that our solution was future-proof as Fructose continued to evolve. The integration reduced development time for future projects by 40%, as we now had a flexible framework in place for adapting new libraries. My approach was well-received by the team, and the documentation I provided made it easier for others to build on this solution later. This experience reinforced the importance of persistence and innovation, even when a tool doesn’t offer full support out of the box.

## 4. **Managing Conflict with a New Backend Developer**

- **Situation**: A new backend developer joined our team and was tasked with delivering a critical feature involving API development, database interactions, and backend service integration. The developer, although experienced, struggled with our specific frameworks and architecture. The project was facing tight deadlines, and the client had high expectations. As the project leader, I realized that the developer’s difficulties could delay our entire delivery, and I needed to step in to avoid missing the deadline.

- **Task**: My task was to ensure that the backend development was completed on time while supporting the new team member's learning curve. I also had to maintain the overall project timeline and deliver the feature without sacrificing quality, all while managing my own workload.

- **Action**: I quickly recognized that I needed to balance mentoring and getting the work done myself. First, I organized regular one-on-one sessions with the new developer to guide them through our architecture, helping them understand key components like database schema design and API setup. I shared code snippets and best practices to help them adapt to our frameworks. Alongside mentoring, I reprioritized my own tasks, taking over some of the more complex aspects of the integration that were blocking the developer’s progress. I ensured they could focus on the parts they were more comfortable with while I completed the more difficult portions. I also took charge of coordinating with the project manager and the client to manage expectations around delivery timelines.

## 5. **Automating Data Ingestion and Deletion**

- **Situation**: My team was facing a significant inefficiency in the process of ingesting data into our vector database. The data ingestion was being done manually, which consumed several hours every week, slowing down productivity and affecting the team's ability to focus on higher-priority tasks. Additionally, there was no system in place to automate the deletion of outdated data, which further increased the manual workload. This process was clearly unsustainable, so I decided to take ownership and streamline the workflow.

- **Task**: My task was to design and implement an automated solution for data ingestion and deletion that would save time, eliminate human error, and free up the team to focus on more value-adding tasks. The solution had to be scalable and secure, ensuring that it integrated seamlessly with our existing AWS-based infrastructure.

- **Action**: I began by analyzing the current manual process to identify key bottlenecks and pain points. I then designed a solution using AWS services, starting with an S3 bucket where documents could be automatically uploaded. I set up an AWS Lambda function to trigger each time a new file was added to the bucket. This function called an API service that ingested the data into our vector database. To address the issue of outdated data, I extended the same pipeline to automate the deletion of old entries using predefined rules. This involved modifying the Lambda function to check for stale data and delete it from the vector database at regular intervals. Throughout the process, I collaborated closely with the DevOps team to ensure the infrastructure was secure, scalable, and aligned with our existing systems. I also documented the entire workflow so that the team could easily maintain and extend the automation in the future.

- **Result**: The automation saved the team 5 hours of manual work per week, significantly boosting overall productivity. The new system reduced errors associated with manual data handling and improved the team’s ability to focus on more critical tasks. The deletion automation further ensured that the vector database remained up to date, reducing storage costs and keeping the data set clean. This solution became the new standard for data ingestion and management in the team, and it improved the overall workflow efficiency. Stakeholders appreciated the increased operational efficiency, and the team welcomed the opportunity to focus on more impactful work.

- **What I Gained**: This project strengthened my ability to design end-to-end automated solutions that integrate multiple AWS services.

## 6. **Conflict Over Approach to RAG Model Optimization**

- **Situation**: I was leading a project to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a client who needed an AI system to generate accurate, context-based answers from a large internal knowledge base. The project involved balancing the retrieval mechanisms with generative model outputs. While we were in the implementation phase, there was a conflict within the team regarding the best approach to optimize the retrieval part. I advocated for using a hybrid search approach that combined vector embeddings and traditional keyword search to enhance retrieval accuracy, especially for ambiguous queries. However, one of the senior engineers felt strongly that we should stick to just vector embeddings, arguing that hybrid search would add unnecessary complexity and slow down the response time.

- **Task**: My task was to resolve the disagreement, make a decision that was in the best interest of the project, and ensure that the team was aligned moving forward. I also had to maintain client satisfaction by ensuring the system’s performance was optimized both in terms of speed and accuracy.

- **Action**: To address the conflict, I scheduled a dedicated meeting where both sides could present their perspectives. I encouraged the senior engineer to demonstrate how a pure vector-based retrieval would handle ambiguous queries and allowed the team to see the potential benefits and limitations. On my side, I demonstrated how a hybrid search method could provide more relevant results in cases where vector embeddings alone might miss key nuances, particularly for highly specific queries. After this technical evaluation, I facilitated an open discussion and acknowledged the concerns about complexity and response time. To settle the matter, we agreed to run a series of A/B tests using real user data to compare both approaches. This allowed us to gather empirical evidence about the performance impact of both methods.

- **Result**: The A/B tests showed that while vector-based retrieval was faster, it struggled with certain complex queries, leading to lower relevance in those cases. On the other hand, the hybrid approach improved accuracy, particularly for ambiguous or niche queries, with only a minimal impact on response time. Based on the data, the team agreed to adopt the hybrid retrieval method for this specific use case, while also optimizing for performance in future iterations. This not only resolved the conflict but also led to a more robust RAG model that delivered better results to the client. The project was delivered successfully, and the client expressed high satisfaction with the system’s ability to handle complex queries efficiently.

- **What I Gained**: This experience helped me develop stronger conflict resolution skills, particularly in navigating technical disagreements. I learned the importance of backing decisions with data and allowing both sides to voice their concerns while driving the project forward. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of the balance between complexity and performance in RAG systems, and how to make decisions that optimize both accuracy and speed. This also strengthened my ability to guide technical teams through complex decisions, keeping both the team and client outcomes in focus.
